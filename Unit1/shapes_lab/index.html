	There are many shapes which are at thier simplest are combination of dots drawn on a white/blank space.
	You can draw on a sheet of paper with a pen or pencil. Draw on a screen with a mouse or ball-point. 
	No matter what shapes look or function, they are important to shape and measure things we use in the real world.
