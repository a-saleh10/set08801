	<h2>Polygon</h2>
	<p>In geometry, a polygon can be defined as a flat or plane, two-dimensional closed shape bounded with straight sides. 
	It does not have curved sides. The sides of a polygon are also called its edges. 
	The points where two sides meet are the vertices (or corners) of a polygon.
